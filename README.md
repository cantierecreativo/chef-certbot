# certbot Cookbook

This cookbook configures and installs SSL certificates from Let’s Encrypt.

The xamples below are for Nginx, but the cookbook is web server agnostic and
works just the same with Apache.

## Domain Validation

Let's Encrypt needs to see that you control the server that responds to
the domain name for which you're requesting the certificate.

One of this cookbook's functions is to set up your server to respond to
the call made by the Let's Encrypt server.

### Platforms

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Chef

- Chef 12.0 or later

## The First Run Problem

Suppose you want to add SSL to a new server or an existing one.

Your server cookbook could have an nginx or apache template that
expects to find an SSL certificate in a certain path.
You could think to write something like this:

File `/etc/nginx/sites-available/www.example.com`

```
server {
  listen 443;
  ssl on;
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/cert.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/key.pem;

  location ^~ /.well-known {
    alias /var/www/letsencrypt/www.example.com/.well-known;
  }
}
```

Kicking off certificate installation has a chicken and egg problem.

The web server needs to be used to handle domain validation, but
with the above configuration, the web server will fail to (re)start before
the certificate has been obtained.

To avoid this, use the **self\_signed\_certificate** resource to create
a self-signed certificate and install it in the
**/etc/letsencrypt/current/www.example.com/** directory

In a recipe, you can write something like this:

```
certbot_self_signed_certificate "www.example.com" do
end

template "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/www.example.com.conf" do
  ...
  notifies :reload, "service[nginx]", :immediately                # now nginx is reloaded with a self-signed certificate, and Let's Encrypt is able to validate the domain
end

certbot_certificate "www.example.com" do
  email "webmaster@example.com"
  notifies :reload, "service[nginx]", :immediately                # when nginx is reloaded, it will point to the new valid certificates
end
```

## Attributes

### default

* `node['certbot']['webroot_dir']` - The webroot used during domain validation.
  Defaults to `/var/www/letsencrypt`.
* `node['certbot']['working_dir']` - Path for the generated self-signed
  certificate and working directoy. Defaults to `/etc/letsencrypt`.
* `node['certbot']['rsa_key_size']` - Size for the RSA key. Defaults to 4096

## Resources and Providers

### Certificate

Generate a new valid SSL certificate through Let’s Encrypt, and activate it.

### self\_signed\_certificate

Creates a new self-signed certificate for provided domain and activates it.

#### Actions

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Action</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Default</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>:install</td>

        <td>If true, the self signed certificate will be overridden by a new one</td>
        <td>false</td>
        <td>false</td>
    </tr>
 </table>

### activate_certificate

Enables the provided certificate and private key as the current certificate,
creating 2 symlinks under `/etc/letsencrypt/current/#{domain}/`.

For example, for domain `www.example.com` it will create:

* /etc/letsencrypt/current/www.example.com/cert.pem
* /etc/letsencrypt/current/www.example.com/key.pem
